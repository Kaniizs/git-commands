#### Note on Paths

In this file, directory paths are written with a forward slash as on MacOS, Linux, and the Windows-Bash shell: `/dir1/dir2/somefile`.    


## Basics

1. When using Git locally, what are these?  Define each one in a sentence
   ```
   * Staging area - The staging area is where changes are stored until they are committed to the repository.
   * Working copy - The working copy is the local copy of the repository.
   * master - The master is a branch that is the default branch.
   * HEAD - HEAD is referring to the current branch
   ```

2. When you install git on a new machine (or in a new user account) you should perform these 2 git commands to tell git your name and email.  These values are used in commits that you make:
   ```
   -git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   -git config --global user.email Yourname@example.com
   ```

3. There are 2 ways to create a local Git repository.  What are they?
   ```
   -git init - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
   -git clone <url> - Clones the repository at the given URL into the current directory.
   ```

4. When you create a git repository by entering `git init`, Git will create a "hidden" directory for the local repository.  Where is the directory for this local repository (relative to the directory where you typed "git init")?
   ```
   .git : The hidden directory for the local repository.
   ls -a : Lists all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
   ```
   

## Adding and Changing Things

Suppose your working copy of a repository contains these files and directories:
```
README.md
out/ 
    a.exe
src/a.py
    b.py
    c.py
test/
    test_a.py
    ...
```     


1. Add README.md and *everything* in the `src` directory to the git staging area.
   ```
   git add README.md
   git add src
   ```

2. Add `test/test_a.py` to the staging area (but not any other files).
   ```
   git add test/test_a.py
   ```

3. List the files in the staging area.
   ```
   git ls-files --stage
   
   ```


4. Remove `README.md` from the staging area. (Useful if you accidentally add something you don't want to commit.)
   ```
   git rm README.md
   ```


5. Commit everything in the staging area to the repository.
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```


6. Describe 2 steps to configure the repository so git will ignore all files in the `out/` directory:
   ```
   -git config core.excludesfile "~/.gitignore" : This command tells git to use the file ~/.gitignore to ignore files.
   -git update-index --assume-unchanged out/ : This command tells git to ignore all files in the out/ directory.
   ```

7. Command to move all the .py files from `src` to the top-level directory of this repository, so they are also moved in the Git repo.
   ```
   git mv src/* .
   ```


8. Commit this change with the message "moved src directory":
   ```
   git commit -m "moved src directory"
   ```


9. Command to add **all changed files** (but not untracked files) to the staging area using a single command.
   ```
   git add -u
   ```


10. **Delete** the file `c.py` from your working copy **and** the repository:
    ```
    git rm -r c.py
    ```



## Undo Changes and Recover Files

1.  Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the `a.py` in the *local repository* (HEAD revision):
    ```
    git diff a.py
    ```

2. Display the differences between your *working copy* of `a.py` and the version in the *staging area*. (But, if a.py is not in the staging area this will compare working copy to HEAD revision):
      ```
      git diff --cached a.py
      ```

3. **View changes to be committed:** Display the differences between files in the staging area and the versions in the repository. (You can also specify a file name to compare just one file.)
      ```
      git diff --staged
      ```


4. **Undo "git add":** If `main.py` has been added to the staging area (`git add main.py`), remove it from the staging area:
      ```
      git reset HEAD main.py
      ```


5. **Recover a file:** Command to replace your working copy of `a.py` with the most recent (HEAD) version in the repository.  This also works if you have deleted your working copy of this file.
      ```
      git checkout a.py
      ```


6. **Undo a commit:** Suppose you want to discard some commit(s) and move both HEAD and "master" to an earlier revision (an earlier commit)  Suppose the git commit graph looks like this (`aaaa`, etc, are the commit ids)
   ```
   aaaa ---> bbbb ---> cccc ---> dddd [HEAD -> master]
   ``` 
   The command to reset HEAD and master to the commit id `bbbb`:
   ```
   git reset --hard bbbb
   ```



7. **Checkout old code:** Using the above example, the command to replace your working copy with the files from commit with id `aaaa`:
   ```
   git checkout aaaa
   ```
   
    Note:
    - Git won't let you do this if you have uncommitted changes to any "tracked" files.
    - Untracked files are ignored, so after doing this command they will still be in your working copy.
 

## Viewing Commits

1. Show the history of commits, using one line per commit:
   ```
   git log --oneline
   ```
   Some versions of git have an *alias* "log1" for this (`git log1`).

2. Show the history (as above) including *all* branches in the repository and include a graph connecting the commits:


3. List all the files in the current branch of the repository:
   ```
   git ls-files
   ```
   example output:
   ```
   .gitignore
   README.md
   a.py
   b.py
   test/test_a.py
   test/test_b.py
   ```


## Branch and Merge

1. Create a new branch named `dev-foo`:
   ```
   git branch dev-foo
   ```
 
2. Display the name of your current branch:
   ```
   git branch
   ```

3. List the names of **all** branches, including remote branches:
   ```
   git branch -a
   ```

4. Switch your working copy to the branch named `dev-foo`:
   ```
   git checkout dev-foo
   ```
   

5. **Merge:** To merge the work from `dev-foo` into the master branch, perform these steps:
   
   
   1. step one
      ```
      Change the active branch back from dev-foo to master using `git checkout master`.
      ```
      
   2. step two
      ```
      Merge the changes from dev-foo into master using -git merge dev-foo.
      ```


6. Describe under what conditions a merge may fail.
   ```
   - Conflicts - if there are any conflicts, the merge will failed.
   - Fast-forward - if the merge results in a fast-forward, the merge will succeed.
   - Non-fast-forward - if the merge results in a non-fast-forward, the merge will fail.
   ```
   




## Favorites
   ```
   Viewing commits : It's really useful that we can view the history of commits in the repository. 
   To do this, we can use the command `git log`. or `git log --oneline`.
   Also we can list all the files in the current branch of the repository using the command `git ls-files`.
   ```
